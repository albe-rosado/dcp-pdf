# Daily Coding Problem (DCP) solutions

Collect your DCP sunbscription solutions to nice pdf documents you can read in any of your devices.


## Usage

Clone this repo 
``` bash
// Obviously you need Node js and npm(or yarn, pnpm....) installed 
npm i

node .

```
a folder called `solutions` will be created and all your solutions files will be inside, named by the solution numbers. 


## Work in progress
I do want to improve this a little more,

- improve performance
- produce a single pdf file
- anything else i could come up with later...

 if you feel is so gross you can't wait(it is), submit a PR yourself.
