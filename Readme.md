# Daily Coding Problem (DCP) solutions

Collect your DCP subscription solutions to a nice pdf document you can read in any of your devices.


## Usage

Clone this repo and execute
``` bash
// Obviously you need Node js and npm(or yarn, pnpm....) installed 
npm i && node .
```
a file called `dcp.pdf` will be created with all your coding problem solutions. :see_no_evil:

### Dependencies
I'm using [PDFtk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) in this project, go to their website to download it (free) for your platform.

You could automate this to produce an updated file every day.

## :point_right::construction_worker:Work in progress:construction_worker::point_left:

I do want to improve this a little more,

- ~~produce a single pdf file~~
- anything else I could come up with later...

 if you feel so gross you can't wait, submit a PR yourself.
